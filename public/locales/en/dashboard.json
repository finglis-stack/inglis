All fees are in Canadian Dollars (CAD) and are non-refundable.\n\n4. **Compliance and Security**: You agree to use the Provider's platform in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. You are responsible for the security of your cardholders' data within your own systems.\n\n5. **Limitation of Liability**: The Provider will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from your management of the card program, including fraud, user payment defaults, or operational errors on your part.\n\nBy checking the box below, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted these terms and conditions, and that you are authorized to bind your institution to this agreement.",
